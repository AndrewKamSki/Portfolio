# Andrew-Kaminski-Portfolio

## Description

This is a landing page for me, Andrew Kaminski, to display and share my work.

As an aspiring web developer, I want to have a place where I can display my work in a creative way to people I care about.
This is also a place that potential employers can review my work which can be a real benefit in a job hunt.

The website landing page I have created is a great start to display information about myself, projects I'm working on/ will work on, etc.

I know now that there is much more I will need to do to make this site shine. I want to add new pages to display different kinds of projects
and add in my updated Resume.

## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

🏆 The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
